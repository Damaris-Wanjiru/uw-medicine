            <p>Are you putting off getting a mammogram because you’re worried about how much it will <br>cost? There’s good news from Washington state that might make it easier for you. As of <br>January 1, 2024, many people with commercial health insurance* won’t have to pay anything <br>extra for important breast checks. This includes: <br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>More tests like detailed mammograms and ultrasounds if your first check shows something unusual.</li>
                <li>Tests for people who have symptoms, such as lumps, bleeding, or skin changes.</li>
                <li>Extra checks for people who are at a higher risk of getting breast cancer. If you’re <br>wondering whether you’re at high risk,<br> the genetic counselors at our High Risk Screening & Genetics Clinic can help determine if genetic testing is right for you.</li>

                 and sugary drinks.</p>
